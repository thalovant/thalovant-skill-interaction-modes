Last Edit: Codex (GPT-6) - 2026-09-30 - Motive: Add missing license files and document verified repository languages.

# Maintenance report

## 2026-09-30: license and language metadata

Added a root Apache-2.0 license, documented GitHub's detected languages (Python), and updated repository reference, audit, and navigation files. License basis: Existing [setup.py](setup.py) declaration.

Verification: `python -m pytest test -q --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings` — ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'thalovant_skillkit'; collection blocked in the local environment.

### Transparency Report

- AI Model: GPT-6 (Codex).
- Actions Taken: inspected GitHub metadata, package declarations, source symbols and tests; added license text and documentation; checked the final diff.
- Oversight: the user requested the update and explicitly selected proprietary terms for repositories with no existing declaration. The assistant performed automated validation; no human line-by-line review is claimed.

Metadata validation: 116 checks passed across the 29 repositories (canonical license text, new documentation links and headers, source citations, and metadata-only change scope).
